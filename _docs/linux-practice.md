## iptables 

1. Block a Specific IP: Define rules to block all traffic from a particular IP address and log any attempts.

2. Allow HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Only: Configure rules that allow incoming traffic on ports 80 and 443 while denying all other incoming connections.

3. SSH Access Restriction: Allow SSH connections only from a specific subnet or trusted IP range.

4. Rate Limiting: Set up rules to limit the rate of incoming connections for a particular service (such as SSH or web traffic).

5. Drop ICMP Requests: Create a rule that drops or limits ICMP (ping) requests.

6. Port Forwarding with NAT: Establish a NAT rule to forward traffic from one port to another.

7. Custom Chain Creation: Develop a custom chain to handle and process specific types of traffic, then integrate that chain into your main rules.

8. Stateful Filtering: Implement rules that filter traffic based on connection states (e.g., NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED, INVALID).

9. Default Deny Policy: Write a script that flushes existing rules and sets a default deny policy, while adding exceptions for essential services.

10. Traffic Logging: Create rules that log suspicious or dropped packets to help analyze network activity later.
