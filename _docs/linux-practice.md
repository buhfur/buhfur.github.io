## iptables 

- [ ] Block a Specific IP: Define rules to block all traffic from a particular IP address and log any attempts.

- [ ] Allow HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Only: Configure rules that allow incoming traffic on ports 80 and 443 while denying all other incoming connections.

- [ ] SSH Access Restriction: Allow SSH connections only from a specific subnet or trusted IP range.

- [ ] Rate Limiting: Set up rules to limit the rate of incoming connections for a particular service (such as SSH or web traffic).

- [ ] Drop ICMP Requests: Create a rule that drops or limits ICMP (ping) requests.

- [ ] Port Forwarding with NAT: Establish a NAT rule to forward traffic from one port to another.

- [ ] Custom Chain Creation: Develop a custom chain to handle and process specific types of traffic, then integrate that chain into your main rules.

- [ ] Stateful Filtering: Implement rules that filter traffic based on connection states (e.g., NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED, INVALID).

- [ ] Default Deny Policy: Write a script that flushes existing rules and sets a default deny policy, while adding exceptions for essential services.

- [ ]  Traffic Logging: Create rules that log suspicious or dropped packets to help analyze network activity later.
