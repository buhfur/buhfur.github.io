## Time based studying tasks 

- [ ] Setup token based auth on both test servers in 4 minutes or less 

## Resetting Root Password 

1. Reboot to grub menu 

2. Add `init=/bin/sh` to the end of the kernel arguments 

3. `mount -o remount,rw /` , to remount the filesystem 

4. `passwd root` 

5. `touch /.autorelabel` , if using selinux 


### Why Re-Labeling the filesystem is necessary 

If you fail to relabel the filesystem after changing the root password. The /etc/shadow file will be updated , but in this instance the file is update outside of a selinux aware envionrment. If not relabeled , selinux will see an updated file with a wrong or missing label. As a result of this , assuming SElinux is booted into enforcing mode, PAM or login processes will be denied access to /etc/shadow. Which will need to be readable to allow access to the system.

## Managing disks

### Change label of disk 

`dosfslabel` -> Used for changing labels on dos filesystems 

`e2label` -> used for changing labels on ext[1-4] disks 

`fatlabel` -> set or get label on dos filesystem 

## unrelated helpful snippets  

`echo "password" | sudo -S dnf update` -> pipes password into sudo commandfrom STDIN  

`for x in $(groupmems -l -g groupname); do mkdir /mnt/somedir/$x; done` -> snippet which creates a directory for all users in the "groupname" group 

`for x in /mnt/somedir/*; do chown -R $(basename $x):$(basename $x) $x; done` -> recursively assign ownership for all subdirectories where the subdir is the name of the user. 

`. /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion` -> Add this line to your bashrc to enable bash-completion 

## output redirection & piping 

STDIN:
- `<` or `0<` 
- destination: keyboard 
- File Decriptor: 0

STDOUT:
- `>` or `1>` 
- destination: monitor 
- File Decriptor: 1
    

STDERR:
- `2>`
- destination: monitor 
- File Decriptor: 2

### redirection Examples 

`>> or 1>>` -> redirects STDOUT in append mode 

`2>&1` -> redirects STDERR to same dest as STDOUT

`ls /home/ryan 1> /dev/tty1` -> redirects output to console on server

`ls /home/ryan 2>&1 > /dev/null` -> redirects STDERR to same location as stdout and sends to /dev/null device file. 

`passwd manny --stdin < pass.txt` -> use file as stdin for setting password for user 

`for x in $(tail -n6 /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print $1}'); do echo 'password' | passwd $x --stdin` -> Change password for 6 users 
## swapfiles

### Swapfile as file 

Create a 32G swapfile 

`dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=32` 

`mkswap /swapfile`

`swapon /swapfile`

### Swapfile As Partition 

1. Create partition on disk using fdisk or gdisk 

2. Make type of partition 8200 ( gdisk ) , 19 ( fdisk)

3. Run partprobe if the partition doesn't show up in lsblk or blkid 

4. `mkswap /dev/sdxY` , formats partition as swap 

5. Add disk by PARTLABEL or UUID into fstab 

6. `swapon /dev/sdxY to activate swapfile`

## crontab 
- /var/spool/cron/username -> crontab for user 
- do man 5 crontab for possible combinations 
- cronnext -i root -> get time in seconds from now when next cronjob from user will run  

### Get date when next cronjob will run 

`date -d "@$(cronnext -i root | awk -F " " '{print $2}'" ` -> get date when next cronjob for root user will run 

## at 

`atq` -> lists pending jobs 

`echo "echo \'this is easy\!'\ >> /some_dir/file.txt" | at now + 10 minutes`
## chmod 

SUID -> chmod u+s , chmod 4XXX

SGID -> chmod g+s , chmod 2xxx /somedir

Sticky Bit -> chmod +t , chmod 1XXX

## history 

`history -c` -> clears current history 

`history -w` -> remove current history and `.bash_history` file 

`history -d <number> ` -> deletes item from history 

## umask 

> Umask values subtract from the max value for files/directories. Files=666, Directories=777

F= Files , D=Directories

0 -> F: Read and write , D: everything 

1 -> F: Read and write , D: Read and write  

2 -> F: Read, D: Read and Execute  

3 -> F: Read , D: Read 

4 -> F: Write , D: Execute

5 -> F: Write , D: Write

6 -> F: Nothing , D: Write

7 -> F: Nothing, D: Nothing 

**Set default permissions for all newly created files**

In /etc/login.defs as root , change the following line to below.

```bash
umask 007 
```

The change above makes all newly created files with 660 permissions and directories with 770 permissions by default.  

## Find 

`find / -user <user>`

`find / -group <group>`

`find / -perm -u=s ` -> finds all files with SUID permission bit set  

`find / -perm -4000` -> same as above but in octal notation 

`find / -perm -g=s` -> finds all files with SGID perm bit set 

`find / -perm -2000` -> octal notation for above 

`find / -perm -1000` -> finds all files with sticky bit set 

`find / -user <user> -type f -exec cp --parents -a {} /somedir \;` -> copy all files owned by specific user to directory

`~/.bash_profile` -> user-specific login shell variables 

`~/.bashrc` -> user-specific file , subshell variables can be defined

> Note: The "su" command **WILL NOT** source a .bashrc in the root directory , according to the documentation of su , only the $SHELL, $HOME, $USER ( if not root user ) , and $LOGNAME are set. To avoid this , use the "--login" option instead of the "-" shortcut. 

## man 

`man -k <keyword`

## Process Management 

Start process with lower priority
```bash
nice -n 10 ./script.sh 
```

Increase process priority  
```bash
renice +5 `pgrep script.sh`
```

Kill process 
```bash
```

## User and Group management 

chmod -> change permissions for directories and files  

chgrp -> change group owner of file  

chage -> change password age of users password 

chown -> change user and group ownership of files   

id -> get UID, GID , and groups of users via their username 

groupmod -> change GID of group 

groupmems -> view users apart of a specific group 

`groupmems -g dudes -l` -> view members of a specific group  

`id -u <username>`  -> just UID 

`id -u <username>`  -> just GID 
- /etc/default/useradd -> defaults for users 
- /etc/login.defs  -> defaults for users 

### Script to verify if group exists in bash 

```bash
# !/bin/bash

GROUP_NAME="mygroup"

if getent group "$GROUP_NAME" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Group '$GROUP_NAME' exists."
else
    echo "Group '$GROUP_NAME' does not exist."
fi
```
## usermod 

`usermod -aG wheel <user>` -> adds user to wheel group to make them admin privs 

## useradd 

`useradd -m -u 1201 -G sales,ops linda` -> creates user with home dir and UID of 1201 , adds user to groups sales & ops 

`useradd -aG <group-name> [user1..userx]` -> syntax for adding one or multiple users to a group  

## sudo file 

`<username> ALL=/usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/passwd` -> give user the ability to execute useradd and passwd commands without requiring root privs. User still needs to prepend 'sudo' before running command   

`Defaults timestamp_timeout=240` -> sets sudo token timeout  

`ALL=/usr/bin/useradd, /usr/bin/passwd, ! /usr/bin/passwd root` -> prevents users granted passwd execution from changing the password of the root user 

`sudo sh -c "<command> | <command> ` -> syntax for piping sudo commands 

`pkexec visudo` -> allows changing the visudo file if access is unavailable 

`vipw` -> allows changing config files for users directly in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow 

`vigr` -> same as vipw but for changing configs for groups 

`Cmnd_Alias MESSAGES = /bin/tail -f /var/log/messages` -> sudo command alias that runs tail on /var/log/messages 
- Command aliases allow you to let selected users / groups to launch specific commands without prompting for a password 

`ryan ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: MESSAGES` -> Enables the use of the command alias made earlier to be executed without a password 

### Rule syntax 

```bash
# ---
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# ---
root         → the user this rule applies to  
ALL          → from any host  
(ALL:ALL)    → may run commands as any user (1st ALL) and any group (2nd ALL)  
ALL          → may run **all commands**
```
## chage & passwd  

`passwd -n 30 -w 3 -x 90 linda ` -> sets minimal password usage to 30 days , with 3 days of warning , expires after 90 days 

`chage -m 30 -W 3 -M 90 linda ` -> same thing but using chage instead of apasswd  

`chage -E 2025-12-31 bob` -> sets bobs account to expire at a certain date 
`chage -l` -> view current password management settings  

### Change users shell and only let them change password 

1. Create a script in /usr/local/bin/change-pass.sh

2. put this line in the script "passwd <username> "

3. then change the users shell using the tool of your preference 

```bash
# !/bin/bash
/usr/bin/passwd
exit
```

4. User will only be able to change their own password 
## Special permissions basics 

SUID -> on files , files are executed with the permissions of of the file owner 

SGID -> on files , files are executed with permissions of group owner 
on directories , newly created files are assigned group owner 

Sticky bit -> prevents users from deleting files from other users

> Tip: Don't use sticky bit on files, it's ignored. Use on directories.

## chmod 

4 -> read 

2 -> write 

1 -> execute 

s -> on directories , SGID and execute are set , on files , SUID and execute are set 

S -> on directories,only SGID is set  , on files , only SUID is set 

t -> sticky bit and execute are set 

T -> only sticky bit is set 

`chmod 755 file.txt` -> user has full rwx , group has rx , others has rx 

`chmod -R a+X /home/somedir` -> sets execute perm for all users and sub dirs contained within 

`chmod 4755 /somedir` -> set SUID on dir 

`chmod u+s /somedir` 

`chmod 2755 /somdir` -> set SGID on dir  

`chmod g+s /somedir` 

`chmod 1755 /somedir ` -> set sticky 

`chmod +t /somedir`

## groupmems 

`groupmems -l -g workers` -> lists users in workers group 

## umask 

> Subtract perm values 

Umask changes default permissions for all users 

`umask 777 somedir ` -> defaults for directories 

`umask 666 somefile ` -> defaults for files 

/etc/profile.d/umask.sh -> file for setting default umask permissions for all users that login to the server , root user created 

You could also change the default umask by changing /etc/profile 

For individual users you could also add a .profile file in the /etc/skel directory and change the umask there 

## User-extended attributes 

> Package: e2fsprogs 

A -> file access time , makes sure it's not modified 

a -> allows file to be added but not removed, can even prevent root user from deleting file 

c -> if volume-level compression is supported, assures files are compressed when the compression engine starts  

D -> changes to files are written to disk immediately and not cached first, important for databases  

d -> makes sure the file is not backed up when the dump utility is used 

I -> enables indexing for the directory where it's enabled 

i -> makes file immutable , good for security , also can't be changed by root user 

s -> overwrites blocks where file was stored with 0's after file is deleted , makes sure recovery of the file is not possible after deletion. 

u -> saves undelete info , allows a utility that can work with that info to salvage deleted files  

`chattr +s somefile` -> adds s attribute to file 

`chattr -s somefile` -> removes s attribute from file 

`lsattr <somefile>` -> view attributes of file or all files in current directory  

## classed networks   

10.0.0.0/8 -> a single A class network 

172.16.0.0/12 -> 16 class B networks 

192.168.0.0/16 -> 256 Class C networks 

## nmcli

> Tip: make sure the bash-completion package is installed and the lines mentioned in "unrelated helpful snippets" is put into your bashrc 

> Tip: man nmcli-examples 

> Tip: use nm-connection-editor

> Configs for network cards : /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections

`nmcli` -> basic network interface overview 

`nmcli general permissions` -> view gen perms 

`nmcli con show` -> show specific connections  

**Add ipv4 address and gateway to existing connection**

`nmcli con mod <connection-name> ipv4.addresses <ip-address>/<prefix> ipv4.gateway <gateway-ip> ipv4.method manual`

`nmcli con down <con-name> && nmcli con up <con-name>`

**Create ipv4 connection using DHCP** 

`nmcli con add con-name <name> type <type> ifname <ifname> ipv4.method auto` -> creates a connection using the ipv4.method which uses DHCP

**Create static ipv4 connection with gateway** 

`nmcli con add con-name <name> type <type> ifname <ifname> autoconnect no type ethernet ip4 <ip>/<cidr> gw4 <gw-ip> ipv4.method manual` -> creates a new network connection with static IP and gateway 

**Configure DNS to not use DHCP**

`nmcli con mod <con-name> ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes`

**Add dns IP to existing connection**

`nmcli con mod <con-name> +ipv4.dns <ip>`

**Make changes persist after reboot**

Change the config in either /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections 

## hostname 

`hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>` -> changes hostname 

`hostnamectl` -> shows basic info about machine , including hostname and kernel version 

## ip 

`ip -s link show ` -> show links and packet transmissions 

`ip addr add 10.0.0.10/24 dev <devname>` -> add new ip to interface 

`ip route add default via <ip> dev <interface>` -> add default route using ip tool

## ss 

`ss -lt` -> listening TCP sockets 

`ss -tul` -> listening TCP and UDP ports 

## dnf 
---

- Only required fields when creating repo server are the name, baseurl , 

### Repo file Syntax 
---

```bash
[label]
name=<string> ( Required )
baseurl=<url> ( Required ) 
metalink=<url>( Optional )
gpgcheck=<1|0>( Optional )
# If gpgcheck=1 , add the line below 
# gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-release-version
```

### Steps to Create Repo with Mounted Installation Media
---

1. Setup directory to mount ROM 
    `mkdir /repo`

2. Mount ROM onto newly created Directory 
    `mount /dev/sr0`

3. Generate repo file using newly created directory as source
    `dnf config-manager --add-repo=file:///repo/BaseOS`

    After doing this , change the [label] to match the repo name. Then add gpgcheck=0 if not using signed packages.
    
> Note: The directory name might be different , on the AlmaLinux minimal installation , it's named "Minimal" , look out for the directory in the installation media that contains the "Packages" and "repodata" directories

4. Search repos to validate it's working 
    ```
    dnf search httpd --repo BaseOS
    dnf search httpd --repo AppStream
    ```

5. ( Optional ) Further Steps to create a Repo server

6. Install httpd and createrepo\_c 
    `dnf install -y httpd createrepo_c`

7. Create HTML directory for repositories 
    `mkdir /var/www/html/repo`

8. Copy repos to the html directory 
    ```
    cp -r -v /repo/BaseOS /var/www/html/repo

# LVM Snippets  

## pvcreate 

`pvcreate /dev/sdxY` -> mark partition as physical volume 

## lvcreate 

`lvcreate -n <lvname> -l <size> <vgname> ` -> create logical volume with absolute size 

## vgcreate 

`vgcreate <name> /dev/sdxY` -> create volume group on LVM partition 

## vgextend 

> Tip: this is used to add another physical volume to a volume group 

`vgextend myvg /dev/sdXY`

`vgextend myvg /dev/sdXY /dev/sdZY` -> adds multiple physical volumes to the volume group 

# Volume naming scheme 

Volumes are named by the device mapper and can be referenced two ways shown below 

`/dev/mapper/<vgname>-<lvname>`

or 

`/dev/<vgname>/<lvname>`

# Steps to create a LVM 
---

1. Create a LVM partition on the block device with type "8e00" if using gdisk , and "8E" if using fdisk , or in fdisk just type "LVM"

2. `pvcreate /dev/sdxY` to Mark partition as physical volume.

3. Run `pvs` command to verify physical volume was created. 

4. `vgcreate <name> /dev/sdxY` to Create and assign physical volume to volume group using command.

5. (optional) `vgcreate <name> /dev/sdxY -s 8M` to change the physical extent size of the VG. 

6. Create the logical volume with an absolute size or relative size using commands below 
    1. `lvcreate -n <lvname> -L 100M <vgname> ` to create a volume with an absolute size
    2. `lvcreate -n <lvname> -l 100 <vgname> ` to create a volume and specify the amount of extents 
    3. `lvcreate -n <lvname> -l 50%FREE <vgname> ` to create a volume with an relative size

7. After creating the logical volume, use `mkfs` to create a filesystem on top of it , using the naming scheme of the logical volume `/dev/<vgname>/<lvname>`

# Resizing LVM's  
---

> Tip: unmount volumes that are being shrunk 

## Resizing Physical Volumes 

`pvresize /dev/sdX` -> resize physical volume 

> Tip: Make sure to expand the filesystem using the logical volume 

## Resizing Logical Volumes 

`lvextend -L +10G /dev/vgname-lvname` -> extend size of logical volume by 10G. 

`lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vgname-lvname` -> extend size of logical volume with all remaining freespace.

`lvreduce -L 10G /dev/vgname/lvname` -> Shrink logical volume. 

## Resizing Root Logical Volume on Proxmox 

1. After updating size of disk , rescan the disk for the updated space , replace 'sdx' with the name of the block device. 

    `echo 1 > /sys/class/block/sdx/device/rescan`

2. Delete the partition , DON'T format , create new partition with LVM type ( use fdisk , cfdisk , parted)

> Tip: before using gdisk , check to make sure your boot partition is MBR or GPT. gdisk should say at the top after opening it.   

3. Expand the physical volume 

    `pvresize /dev/sdxY`

4. Expand the logical volume using lvextend 

    `lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname`

5. expand the filesystem 

    `resize2fs /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname` 

    `xfs_growfs /`

6. reboot and verify changes have been made 

## Resizing Filesystems 

### Ext4 

`resize2fs /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname` -> Grow ext4 filesystem 

`sudo e2fsck -f /dev/vgname/lvname` -> Check ext4 filesystem

`sudo resize2fs /dev/vgname/lvname 10G` -> Shrink filesystem 

### Xfs 

`xfs_growfs /mount/point`

### Brief explanation of LVM's 

Physical volumes are broken into chunks , these chunks are called *physical extents* , these physical extents map one to one to *logical extents*. The size determines how big these chunks are. A logical volume size is always a size that is a multiple of the physical extent size. Therefore if you require bigger logical volumes , it is more efficient to create larger physical extent size since the LVM would require less physical extents to store larger data, thus leading to quicker seek times( how long it takes the LVM to locate the relevant extents needed to store the data )

# NFS 

## Summary 
- download nfs-utils package 
- default version is version 4 
- mount option 'nfsvers'
- use /etc/exports for defining exported directories 
- start nfs-server service 
- add nfs, rpc-bind, mountd services to firewall-cmd, should be builtin
- in nfs version 4 you can use root mounts to mount the root directory of the server and only see shares you have access to 

## /etc/exports example

```bash
/nfsdata *(rw,no_root_squash)
/users *(rw,no_root_squash)
```

`no_root_squash` -> maps root UID "0" to nobody or anonymous UID , this option disables that feature, therefore the root user on the client would have root privilleges on files in the shares. Be very careful with this.  

## Get list of exported directories from NFS server  

`showmount -e nfsserver` -> show shares that are available  

## Mounting NFS share through fstab 

```bash
servername:/sharename /nfs/mount/point nfs sync 0 0 
```

## autofs summary 
- no root perms required 
- setup on both client and server 
- wildcard mounts supported 
- define mount points and secondary file for configuration in /etc/auto.master 
- in secondary file , you specify name of subdir to be created , mount opts , and servername:share
- use wildcard mounts for mounting home directories 

## Autofs Configuration Example 

### /etc/auto.master ( non home exported directory )

```bash
/dirname    /etc/auto.dirname
```

### /etc/auto.dirname  

```bash
subdirname -rw servername:/sharename
```
### Wildcard Mount Setup on Server Machine 
- /etc/exports
    ```bash
/users *(rw,no_root_squash)
    ```

### Wildcard Mount Setup on Client Machine 
- /etc/auto.master
    ```bash
/users  /etc/auto.users
    ```
- /etc/auto.users 

    ```bash
 -rw     servername:/users/& 
    ```

> Note: the '\*' represents the local mount point on the client machine configured in auto.users, the "&" is a placeholder that gets replaced by the key of the current mount request. 

# SELinux 
---

**Use this new page for more up to date info on SELinux snippets**

![SELinux snippets]('./selinux-snippets.md')

## Objectives 

- List and identify SELinux file and process context
- Restore default file contexts
- Manage SELinux port labels
- Use boolean settings to modify system SELinux settings

## Terminology 

**Source Domain:** In a SELinux Policy , represents the object trying to access something. For example a process( PID ) or user( UID ).

**Target Domain:** Object that the source domain is attempting to access. Can represent a file , directory , or network port. 

**Context:** Security label that is used to categorize objects in SELinux.  

**Labels( Context Labels ):** Used to define which source domain has access to which target domain.

**Rule:** Part of a policy that determines which source domain has which access permissions to which target domain.  

## Notes 

By default , all system calls are denied when SELinux is enabled. To allow a system call through , SELinux policies are used. Each policy defines which source domains are allowed to access which target domains.

Up to RHEL 8 , SELINUX=disabled would also disable selinux at boot. You can also use grubby to persistently set the bootloader to boot with selinux=0. You can also add selinux=0 at the end of the kernel command line arguments to disable selinux at boot

For the exam , you will be expected to know how to work with context types, working with roles and users is not a requirement for the exam.  

### SELinux Modes

Enforcing Mode: 
    SELinux is fully operational and enforcing all SELinux rules in the policy.
 
Permissive Mode: 
    All SELinux activity is logged, however no access is blocked. Best used for troubleshooting , however your system will be insecure temporarily.   


### SELinux types 

Targeted: 
    Targeted processes are protected 

Minimum: 
    Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.

Mls:
    Multi Level Security Protection.  

## General Commands / Snippets 

> Note: seinfo is installed with the setools-console package 

> Note: policycoreutils is mandatory for managing SELinux at all from the command line.

`seinfo -u`:
    Lists all available users on the system 

`seinfo -r`:
    Lists all available roles on the system 

`seinfo -t`: 
    Lists all available types on the system 

`seinfo -b`
    Lists all available SELinux booleans on the system 
    

`semanage`:
    SELinux policy management tool
    Install setroubleshoot package through DNF to acquire this tool 

`semanage port -l`:
    Lists all SELinux ports 

`semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp <port>`:
    enable non-traditional port for ssh 

`getsebool -a`:
    Get booleans for specific service 

`getsebool -l`:
    Same as previous command , with more info.

`setsebool <type> <on|off>`:
    Syntax for disabling or enabling a boolean. 

`setsebool <boolean_name> <on(1) | off(0)> -P` -> write boolean changes to disk to make persistent across reboots.

`ls -Z`:
    view selinux context label on object. 

`ps Zaux`: 
    List processes and their context labels 

`ss -Ztul`:
    List ports and their context labels 
`user:role:type:level`:
    full security context label , or context. "User" is the SELinux user ( not linux user , They're different ). "Role" is the role the selinux user can transition to. "Type" is the SELinux type , which is used for access control decisions. "Level" is the optional field used for an MLS label. 

`/var/log/audit/audit.log`:
    Location where SELinux logs are stored. 

`/etc/sysconfig/selinux`:
    File used to change default selinux mode when booting.

`grubby --update-kernel ALL --args selinux=0`:
    disables SELinux post RHEL 8 at boot

`grubby --update-kernel ALL --remove-args selinux`:
    reverts change from previous command.

`selinux=0`:
    Kernel argument for disabling selinux at boot.

`enforcing=0`:
    Kernel argument for setting permissive mode at boot.

`getenforce`:
    View current mode of SELinux if enabled 

`setenforce 0`:
    Temporarily puts SELinux in permissive mode. 

`setenforce 1`:
    Temporarily puts SELinux in enforcing mode. 

`sestatus -v`:
    If used with -v , this command shows detailed info about the current status of SELinux. Shows the current version of the policy and the context labels for some critical parts of the system.

`sepolicy generate`:
    Tool used to allow almost any application to run in a SELinux enabled environment. Note , you must install an additional package to support this , past RHEL 7 , you can install the "policycoreutils-python-utils" package.

## Add Context type to directory 

### Make directory used for storing HTML files for Web Server 

`semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/mydir/(/.*)?"`:
    Adds httpd_sys_content_t context type to directory. the **-a** is used to add a context type , **-t** is used to change the context type. Once this is done , the changes will only be written to the policy and not the filesystem. To finalize this change , you will need to run the restorecon command below 

`restorecon -R -v /mydir`: 
    Follow up from the previous command adding the httpd_sys_content_t context type to the specified directory, to finalize the changes and write this change to the filesystem , use the command above to do so.

### Alternate home directory under root directory 

```bash
semanage fcontext -a -t home_root_t "/newhome"
semanage fcontext -a -e /home /newhome/home
restorecon -R -v /newhome
```

### Change port used for Web Server ( Apache )

```bash
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8008 
```

> Tip: When changing ports,  you do not have to run the restorecon command. The changes will be effective immediately. However , you still should restart the service whose port you are changing to make sure it still works.
