Get SHA sum from all files in current directory.
```bash
find . -type f -exec sha1sum {} \;
```
### `ls`

```bash
ls
ls -l
ls -a
```

Exclude ".." and "." and only show files
```bash
ls -d .[^.]*
```



### `cp`
Copy files and directories.
```bash
cp source_file destination
cp -r source_dir destination_dir
```

### `mv`
Move/rename files and directories.
```bash
mv old_name new_name
mv file_name /path/to/destination/
```

### `rm`
Remove files or directories.
```bash
rm file
rm -r directory
```

### `mkdir`
Create directories.
```bash
mkdir new_directory
mkdir -p parent_dir/child_dir
```

### `rmdir`
Remove empty directories.
```bash
rmdir directory_name
```

---

## File Viewing and Manipulation

### `cat`
Concatenate and display file contents.
```bash
cat file.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
```

### `tac`
Display file contents in reverse.
```bash
tac file.txt
```

### `nl`
Number lines of a file.
```bash
nl file.txt
```

### `head`
Display the beginning of a file.
```bash
head file.txt
head -n 10 file.txt
```

### `tail`
Display the end of a file.
```bash
tail file.txt
tail -f file.log
```

### `wc`
Count lines, words, and characters.
```bash
wc file.txt
wc -l file.txt
```

---

## Disk and File System Utilities

### `df`
Report disk space usage.
```bash
df
df -h
```

### `du`
Estimate file space usage.
```bash
du
du -h directory_name
```

Show largest files and subdirs on system 
```bash
sudo du -xh / | sort -hr | head -n 10

#show largest in current directory 
sudo du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr
#mixed 
sudo du -ahx / | sort -rh | head -n 20
```

Show all files in current directory size in different units.The 3 lines below shows the sizes in kilobytes 
```bash
du -k * 
```

```bash
du --block-size=1K * 
```

```bash
du -B 1K *
```

## File Permissions and Ownership

### `chmod`
Change file permissions.
```bash
chmod 644 file.txt
chmod +x script.sh
```

### `chown`
Change file owner and group.
```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```

---

## Text Processing

### `xargs`
Xargs runs a command against every line of input from STDIN.

Get sha1sum from all files in current dirctory using xargs.
```bash
find . -type f | xargs sha1sum
```

The same but with files that have spaces. Null byte character is added in between file names instead of a newline character. The -0 arg tells xargs to treat null byte charactes as a separator. 
```bash
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum
```

Tell xargs to pipe input line by line into command. This helps when the command appended to xargs expects one line of input from an argument. 

Run commands given to xargs in paralell 
```bash
cat domains.txt | xargs -P4 dig -x
```

### `cut`
Remove sections from lines of a file.
```bash
cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd
```

### `sort`
Sort lines of text files.
```bash
sort file.txt
sort -r file.txt
```

### `uniq`
Filter duplicate lines.
```bash
uniq file.txt
uniq -c file.txt
```

### `tr`
Translate or delete characters.
```bash
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt
tr -d '
' < file.txt
```

### `paste`
Merge lines of files.
```bash
paste file1.txt file2.txt
```

### `split`
Split a file into pieces.
```bash
split -l 100 file.txt
```
