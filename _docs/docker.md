# Docker 


## Documenting my docker learning journey 

This section will not be organized in any particular way , my plan is to note any experiments or changes I make which I could reference for future deployments 


## Docker notes 

* other containers in the same bridge network can reference each other by their container name for example : http://jellyfin:8096. This references the container named "jellyfin" and attempts to connect through port 8096. 

## Goals 

- [ ] setup docker container for adguard home 
- [ ] setup docker container for jellyfin media-server 
- [ ] setup monitoring dashboard for all existing docker containers
