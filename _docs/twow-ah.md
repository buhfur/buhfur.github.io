# Turtle WoW AH 

Turtle WoW has a website where you can view the prices of items from the last 30 days online. I have discovered the API used for this follows a simple schema , I have an idea in mind which is to create an addon that allows players to get the prices of items on the auction house in game. 

There are a few ways to implement this , and i'm researching for ways that don't require using discord plugins and a constantly logged in character. 

My guild uses a discord bot which allows people to send messages to the guild channel in game from a discord text channel. These messages are appended with the real players name, but they are mainly sent from a proxy character that is always logged in ( I think ). 

My goal is to use this "WoW Chat" addon on a private discord server that will send private messages or "whispers" to me once I whisper the character the item I would like  to pull from from the AH. 

I am not happy with this idea as it still requires the use of a 3rd party application to send/receive the messages of data about the items on the AH.
